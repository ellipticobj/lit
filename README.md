# lit 

# what is this?
lit is my own personal git-like version control system made in python  
this is definitely NOT a complete system, and probably never will be  
if you like it you are free to fork/contribute :3  


## why make this?
i wanted to explore the internals of git, and make my own version control system on the way  
also i thought it'd be fun lolz

## installing
please dont...
